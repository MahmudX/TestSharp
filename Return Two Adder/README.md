# Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1 [Easy]

Given a list of numbers and a number ***k***, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to ***k***.

For example, given **[10, 15, 3, 7]** and ***k*** of **17**, return true since *10 + 7* is *17*.

## My Solution

Here I tried to solve this problem in two ways. Sorting and without sorting.

I'm not happy about the efficiency of this algorithm but it works anyway! Give me a hint if you can find any better way!
