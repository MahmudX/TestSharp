# Substring Finder

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## What's already there

C# has a prebuilt method for Retrieving a substring from a long string.

Which is String.Substring Method.

## What I did

I created an algorithm using ***System*** and ***System.Collections.Generic*** namespaces which can perform the similar task.

It's a common interview question nowadays, so I thought to practice and create my own system to complete the task.
